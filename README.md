# Reusable sorter

Sorter that can receive an array, a string or a Linkedlist and sort it with bubble sort.


Can be easily implemented into projects by adding the Sorter-folder into the project and applying the appropriate imports.


Sorter can be tested through the index.ts-file.
There you can uncomment the feature you want to try out by feeding the desired data and running the index.ts
